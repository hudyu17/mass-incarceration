## Overview
This repo features a reproduction of Bruce Western's paper, [`Inside the Box: Safety, Health, and Isolation in Prison`](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.35.4.97), containing `R` scripts and a final `PDF` report [(link here)](https://github.com/hudyu17/mass-incarceration/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf). This analysis revealed that while there are major deficiencies with mass incarceration in the US, pockets of strength still exist to improve the system for all.
